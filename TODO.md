These are some planned improvements for the future.

* add time-dependant territories (with the intention of studying the past too, such as pre-BIOT)
* make the inclusion of BAT optional (it has dominated the sunrise/sunset coverage since 1962)
* make the starting date user-defined
* also survey mountains (as well as coastlines) to see if they can see further even though they are inland
